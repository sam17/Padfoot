# Padfoot

Padfoot is a multi-pedestrian tracker from a moving camera feed. It used Kalman Filter for tracking and uses an indigenous cost matrix propoagation method for data association. 
It also estimates ego-motion to compensate for camera motion to get an improved tracking estimate which is used to reduce the search space for detection.
